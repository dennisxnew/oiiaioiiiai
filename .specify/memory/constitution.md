# oiiaioiiiai Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. MVP & Simplicity Principle
Focus on a testable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and avoid over-design. All development must prioritize delivering a functional core that meets the most critical requirements first. YAGNI ("You Aren't Gonna Need It") is a guiding rule.

### II. Quality & Testability Principle
Produce high-quality and testable products. Every feature must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure correctness, maintainability, and reliability. TDD is strongly encouraged.

### III. Language & Localization Principle
When Chinese is required in any user-facing text, documentation, or internal comments, always use Traditional Chinese (繁體中文).

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme guide for project development, superseding all other practices. Amendments require thorough documentation, team consensus, and a clear migration plan. All code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles.
